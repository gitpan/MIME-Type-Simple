SYNOPSIS
      use MIME::Type::Simple;

      $type = type_from_ext("jpg");        # returns "image/jpeg"

      $ext  = ext_from_type("text/plain"); # returns "txt"  

DESCRIPTION
    This package gives a simple functions for obtaining common file
    extensions from MIME types, and from obtaining MIME types from file
    extensions.

    It is also relaxed with respect to having multiple MIME types associated
    with a file extension, or multiple extensions associated with a MIME
    type. It is defined this way in the default data, but you can have it
    use a system file (e.g. /etc/mime.types) alternatively.

    By default, there is a functional interface, although you can also use
    an object-oriented inteface.

REVISION HISTORY
    For a detailed history see the Changes file included in this
    distribution.

SEE ALSO
    The MIME::Types module has a similar functionality, but a much more
    complex interface.
